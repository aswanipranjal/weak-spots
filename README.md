README

This repository, as the name suggests, is for me to practice, write about and learn some of the computer science fundamentals that I think I am weak at.

Mainly I will be writing about:
- **How does the internet work** and parts of it. (Do you know how cool SSH is? How it works and which kinds of keys it uses?)
- **Data Structures** in some more detail. I know what a binary search tree is, but when do I apply it to a problem?
- **Algorithms** have you heard about Dijkstra's algorithm? It is used to find the shortest path between two points in a system. But how does it work?
- **Regular Expressions** they come in handy when you have a lot of strings to match and not enough time to match them manually
- **Basic computer science fundamentals** What are strongly typed and weakly typed languages? How does the LRU cache work?

I am not sure what else will be included in this repository. This repo will act as a scratch pad of sorts for me to experiment and maybe go into the depths of certain things that I am fimilair with but not confident about.

There will be a separate section about the interview questions that I get asked in the interviews that I've given.
